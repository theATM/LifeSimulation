## Description:

Here one can see a plain board where all the organisms live. It can be hexagonal in nature or square if one desires. Each different organism (differentiated by the colour) has the simple task of surviving as many turns as possible, reproduce and to dominate the board with its offspring. It is in fact not easy. 

Plants such as grass 🌿 🌿 🌿 (light green) are peaceful growing slowly with the passage of time. Watch out for the hungry sheep  🐑 🐑 🐑! They can eat all the grass on the board if unchecked. Here comes a wolf 🐺, it has a simple job - to eat access sheep 🐑. There are much more different species available, a fast antelope, cunning fox, poisonous wolfberries and imported from the east Heracleum sosnowskyi a very dangerous plant for all animals.

In the middle of this there is a player 🏃‍♀️, represented by the blue "human" organism. The player can move across the map dodging all the danger ahead. If lucky it may survive to see how a secret animal the "cyber" 🦾 sheep 🐑 conquers the world 🗺️.

In the spirit of a good show! Best wishes! May best prevail 🎲!
